Read the HOW_TO_BUILD_SIM_FOR_WIN that is part of the brainstem package.

to get current stuff:

we need gcc8 or 9, not the current 5.5.0
make update gcc9


If you do not install MXE in /opt/mxe, you will have to edit some of the build
files that are part of this package.

When you build the static Windows library, it will be installed in the MXE
area, not the standard Linux locations like /usr/local/lib/. The same is true for the include files. To install the headers, once everything is built, type:

make -f Makefile_s64_static_winlib.qt install

The headers and library for Windows builds are not installed as part of the
package because only build systems need these.
