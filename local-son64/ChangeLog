	* configure.ac: Bump to 1.0.3. Needed to undefine UNICODE. Not the default 
	in Linux, but appears to be the default in Windows. Caused run-time errors
	in simrun.exe.

	* Makefile.am: left out a .h file to install in /usr/local/include that
	some builds require.
	* configure.ac: bump to 1.0.1
	* s64_static_winlib.pro: To build debian pkg and include MXE build, need to 
	put the include files in the /opt/mxe area. There really should be a -dev
	package that does this. 
	* configure.ac: bump to 1.0.2
